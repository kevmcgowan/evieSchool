        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Black Death, also known as the Bubonic Plague, was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history.
           It swept through Europe in 1348, killing an estimated 25â€“30 million people, roughly one-third of the continent's population.</p>
        
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>The Black Death was caused by the bacterium <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, which was transmitted through fleas living on rats.
           Poor hygiene, overcrowded living conditions, and a lack of medical knowledge contributed to its rapid spread.</p>
        
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fever and chills</li>
            <li>Swollen and painful lymph nodes (buboes)</li>
            <li>Headaches</li>
            <li>Fatigue and muscle aches</li>
            <li>Black spots or rashes on the skin</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Treatment and Medical Responses</h2>
        <p>In 1348, medical knowledge was limited, and treatments were largely ineffective. Common practices included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bloodletting</li>
            <li>Burning aromatic herbs to "cleanse the air"</li>
            <li>Quarantine measures in some cities</li>
            <li>Religious processions and prayers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Modern understanding of the disease has led to effective treatments with antibiotics, but such remedies were unavailable at the time.</p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>The Black Death had profound social, economic, and cultural impacts, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Labor shortages, leading to higher wages for workers</li>
            <li>Decline in the influence of the Church as traditional beliefs were challenged</li>
            <li>Advances in public health and hygiene in later centuries</li>
        </ul>
